# Celestial Motion – Ray Traced Animation Project

This is a ray-traced animation created as part of an advanced graphics project. The scene features a reflective floor, dynamic celestial bodies, and an animated tennis ball in a starlit environment. The animation showcases various rendering techniques implemented in a custom ray tracer.

## 🌠 Scene Description

The animation begins with a starry background and a reflective chessboard floor supporting two reflective cubes. The Earth glides back and forth overhead, adding a calm yet majestic atmosphere. A tennis ball travels from one cube to another, eventually stopping beneath a wooden table. Meanwhile, Venus, the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter traverse the sky, forming a choreographed orbital pattern that enriches the scene.

## 🛠 Implemented Features

1. **Texture Mapping**  
   Applied to the Earth and other celestial bodies using UV coordinates. Texture color is fetched via bilinear interpolation.

2. **Bump Mapping**  
   Modifies surface normals on the Earth using a bump map to simulate surface irregularities and enhance realism.

3. **Reflection**  
   Shown on the cubes and chessboard floor, using recursively cast reflected rays to simulate light bouncing off shiny surfaces.

4. **Shadows**  
   Calculated using shadow rays cast from the intersection point toward each light source to determine light occlusion.

5. **Object Interaction**  
   The tennis ball interacts spatially with the cubes and floor without intersecting geometry.

6. **Motion Blur**  
   Applied to orbiting planets to simulate realistic camera exposure over time. Rays carry a time parameter and scenes are sampled at multiple time points per frame.

7. **Sound Synchronization**  
   Audio is added in post-processing to match the bounce of the tennis ball and planetary motion using OpenShot.
